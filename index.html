            <h2>CAN YOU REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE?</h2>
            <p>
                You deserve a safe future here on earth.
                Older generations are not doing their part,
                they are not fighting for our future and they seem to be more concerned with the economy than the ecosystem.
                They’re missing one important fact, there will be no economy without a habitable planet.
                We need to put the planet over profit.
                <br><br>
                You can really make a difference. Campaigns have proved to be an effective way to raise awareness and
                Greenpeace is offering you all the tools you need to create your own campaign.
                This is your chance to encourage more ecologically responsible behaviour,
                help spread the word about environmentalism and make the world a better
                 place for your generation and generations to come. Creating your own campaign doesn’t have to be boring,
                 you can make it fun and even do it on your favourite social media platform (like we did).
                 Be inspired and inspire others to take action.</p>

            <h2>SEA LEVELS ARE RISING,<br>BUT SO ARE WE!</h2>
            <p>
                Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organization,
                which uses non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems,
                and to force the solutions which are essential to a green and peaceful future.
                Greenpeace’s goal is to ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity.
                Therefore Greenpeace seeks to: protect biodiversity in all its forms,
                prevent pollution and abuse of the earth’s ocean, land, air and fresh water,
                end all nuclear threats, promote peace, global disarmament and non-violence.
                 <br><br>
                We believe that a better world is not only possible, but that it’s already begun.
                Through the years Greenpeace has conquered many challenges in fighting for the environment.
                In Copenhagen a big milestone was won for meat and dairy campaigns when the municipality
                passed a new food strategy that aims at cutting emissions by 25% by 2030 via meat reduction
                and increase of plant based food served in the city’s canteens, which is around 70,000 meals
                daily at kindergartens, canteens and hospitals. Help us fight for crucial changes like these. On a global scale this is a small step,
                but success in the long run is the sum of small positive changes. </p>
                <h4>Small changes amount to big results.</h4>

            <h2>WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER</h2>
            <p>Never underestimate your power to make an impact,
                just look at Greta Thunberg, who started by launching the “Fridays For Future” movement in 2018,
                now less than two years later she is the world’s most known and prominent climate activist,
                she has created a global attitude shift and a worldwide movement calling for urgent change.
                In September 2019, 4 million people joined her in a strike across 161 countries —
                the largest climate demonstration in history.
                <br><br>
                Greta had to start somewhere,
                she didn’t get to where she is today without putting up a fight. If she didn’t do it, who would?

                Don’t be fooled into thinking that someone else is going do the work for you.
                We are all in this together and we all need to put in the work.
                Success comes when a group of people rise up together towards a common goal.
